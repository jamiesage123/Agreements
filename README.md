# Agreements

This is a plugin for MyBB which allows site admins to add agreements which users can then agree to. Agreements can be attached to a forum category to prevent users from viewing a particular category/forum before they view your agreement.

## Installation

1. Merging all the folders and files in the "UPLOAD" directory to your root directory of your MyBB installation. This process *should not* override any existing files.
2. After installing this plugin, head over to your MyBB "Admin Control Panel" and navigate to "Configuration" -> "Plugins". On this page, you should see the "Agreement" under the "Inactive Plugins" list. Click "Install & Activate".
3. Now, head back to the "Configuration" page and scroll to the bottom of the page to find "Agreements" under "Configuration" on the left side menu. On this page you can add, edit and view your agreements.
